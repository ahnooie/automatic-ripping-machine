Need to write a useful doc file for this code, dealing with the new API and the background
Need to remove my key from the public/production branch when published for pull/commit

Different branches/features:
1) Add ability to shut off disc ejection in config file (as a t/s feature)
2) Clean up all the unnecessary >>LOG redirects throughout files...just because it's neater.
